4 ways to present it:
    A. current:
        1) Perception: Spatial, Temporal, Enemy
        2) Strategy
        3) Giving orders
        4) Executing orders
        5) Integration of domain knowledge
        6) Reasoning with uncertainty
    B. Buro's call for AI research in RTS:
        1) Adversarial planning under uncertainty
        2) Learning and opponent modeling
        3) Spatial and temporal reasoning
    C. Buro and Furtak's full paper:
        1) Adversarial real-time planning
        2) Decision making under uncertainty
        3) Opponent modeling, learning
        4) Spatial and temporal reasoning
        5) Resource management
        6) (Collaboration) 
        7) Pathfinding
    D. Synnaeve's Ph.D thesis (reversed)
        1) Strategy
            opponent modeling, strategy adaptation
        2) Tactics
            enemy prediction, decision-making
        3) Micro-management
            units tracking/filtering, reactive planning/programming
        4) Meta-game and collaboration (discussions, there are no real works)
